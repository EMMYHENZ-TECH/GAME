### Word Chain Game (WCG) - Fun Word Challenge!

Welcome to the **Word Chain Game**, a fun and simple game you can play right in your browser's console!

#### How to Play:

1. **Start with a Word**: You type a word to begin, like "apple."
2. **Follow the Chain**: The computer will think of a word that starts with the last letter of your word. If you type "apple," the computer might say "elephant."
3. **Take Turns**: Now it’s your turn again! You must type a word that starts with the last letter of the computer’s word. For example, if the computer said "elephant," you could type "tiger."
4. **Don’t Repeat Words**: You can’t use the same word twice in the game.
5. **Keep Going**: The game continues until someone can’t think of a word, or if you want to stop, just type "exit."

#### Why Play?

- **Build Your Vocabulary**: Learn new words while having fun.
- **Challenge Yourself**: See how long you can keep the chain going!
- **Easy to Play**: Just type and have fun—no complicated rules!
